#+TITLE: Collection of nim docs in various format

For now, a reference (all functions and variable with description)
manual and the technical manual in org-mode format from
(doc/manual/*.txt) is available in this repo.

Install the manual with ~sudo cp doc/nimref-$version.info.gz
/usr/share/info/nim-ref.info.gz~ or read the technical manual
"doc/manual.org".

* why

I used to browse nim's documentation online but got tired of that
workflow, too many opened tabs. I got used to browsing info (or [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]) manuals in
=emacs= and also with the =info= command. It's much more flexible and
worth a learn. What you get is searchable manual with functions and
variables index.

Example:
[[file:Pictures/2016-05-08-09:38:56_1620x360+0+1051.png]]

* how
** Requirements for build
   - [[http://pandoc.org/index.html][pandoc]]
   - recent version of texinfo
   - writable nim's lib folder ( set =nim_lib_path=/path/to/copy=)

** reference manual
The scripts for generating the doc is included as I tried to make
reproducible for future builds. I am not familiar =texinfo= but recent
versions helped to cope with that. The info manual will not build with
version 4 for example.
Fortunately nim documentation is mostly based on text format so that
we are able to convert .nim -> .json -> .texi -> .info.gz .

** technical manual

=pandoc='s output was not satisfactory as nim's uses a custom =rst=
format. I've been using nim's own rst parser and adapter the rst
generator to a org generator.

* todo

  - [ ] create different index for iterators, macros, etc
  - [ ] reduce =pandoc= usage by modifying =nim jsondoc= code
  - [ ] better texi file templating
  - [ ] handle ~idx~ references
